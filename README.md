# Data Visualization Project

This is my first frontend project. This project was an assignment for the KULeuven course [Data Visualization in Data Science (B-KUL-G0R72A)](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/2023/syllabi/e/G0R72AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp647104). The report on this project can be found in the [data_visualization_report.pdf](https://github.com/stevenhgs/data_visualization/blob/main/data_visualization_report.pdf). We had to make a visualization from [this data](https://github.com/JannesPeeters/suncharge).

Here is a demo of that application:
